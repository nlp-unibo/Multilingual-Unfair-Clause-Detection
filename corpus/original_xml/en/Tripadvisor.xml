BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH TRIPADVISOR

Use of Instant Booking. TripAdvisor offers you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the TripAdvisor site experience. By booking travel reservations facilitated by Instant Booking, you will become a TripAdvisor member if you are not one already. As a TripAdvisor member, you will be able to post travel reviews, participate in discussion forums, email TripAdvisor content to yourself and to others, access and receive members-only newsletters and travel planning content, and enter surveys, contests, or sweepstakes.

<use2><pinc2>By using Instant Booking, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our Privacy Policy and all of these terms and conditions.</pinc2></use2> In addition, you warrant that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use Instant Booking and this site in accordance with these terms and conditions, and that all information you supply is true and accurate. You further agree that you will use Instant Booking only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorized to act. <ter2>Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her TripAdvisor membership terminated.</ter2> If you have a TripAdvisor account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by anyone other than you.

<ltd2>AS A USER OF THIS WEBSITE, INCLUDING INSTANT BOOKING, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) NEITHER TRIPADVISOR NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO BOTH TRIPADVISOR AND OTHER USERS.</ltd2>

When you book a reservation facilitated by Instant Booking, we will collect your payment information and transmit it to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not TripAdvisor, processes your payment and fulfills your reservation. TripAdvisor and its affiliates will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but we reserve the right to cancel or not process a reservation because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. TripAdvisor also reserves the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation.

In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation.

Third-Party Suppliers. TripAdvisor is not a travel agency and does not provide or own transportation services or accommodations. Although TripAdvisor displays information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitates reservations with certain suppliers on Instant Booking and affiliate sites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute TripAdvisor's sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between TripAdvisor and third-party suppliers. Although TripAdvisor members may rate and review particular properties based on their own experiences, TripAdvisor does not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers. You agree that TripAdvisor is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information it obtains from third-party suppliers and displays on its sites or apps.

If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier's terms and conditions of purchase and site use (the "Terms of Use"), Privacy Policy, and any other rules or policies related to the supplier's site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. <ltd2>TripAdvisor will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers.</ltd2>

This Website may link you to supplier sites or other websites that TripAdvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the "Links to Third-Party Sites" section below.

Booking Vacation Rentals with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Affiliate Sites. TripAdvisor and some of its affiliates act as marketplaces to allow travelers to enter into vacation rental agreements or rental transactions with property owners and managers (each, an "Advertiser"). As a user, you must be responsible for your use of this Website, our affiliate sites, and any transaction involving vacation rentals facilitated by Instant Booking and/or listed on affiliate sites. We do not own, manage, or contract for any vacation rental property listed on this Website or our affiliate sites.

Because neither TripAdvisor nor its affiliates are parties to rental transactions between travelers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition, safety or legality of a listed property, the accuracy of the listing content, the Advertiser's ability to rent a vacation rental property, or your ability to pay for a vacation rental property, is solely the responsibility of each user. You understand and agree that you may be required to enter into a separate rental agreement with an Advertiser before making a reservation or purchasing a product or service, and such an agreement may place additional restrictions on your reservation, product or service.

Vacation Rental Payment Terms

You agree to pay an Advertiser or a TripAdvisor affiliate acting on behalf of an Advertiser the service fee for any vacation rental reservation in accordance with the Terms of Use on the affiliate site. A TripAdvisor affiliate may act as an Advertiser's limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser.

For further information on vacation rental fees, security deposits, payment processing, and cancellations and refunds, please consult the Terms of Use of our affiliate sites. <use2><pinc2>By making a vacation rental reservation facilitated by one of our affiliate sites, you acknowledge and agree to that site's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</pinc2></use2>

TRAVEL DESTINATIONS

International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using this Website, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.

For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. TripAdvisor accepts no liability for travelers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveler's failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries the traveler may just be passing through en route to his or her destination.

It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.

Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. TripAdvisor urges passengers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the UK Government, the European Union (EU) and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. BY LISTING INFORMATION RELEVANT TO TRAVEL TO PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, TRIPADVISOR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.

7. PC Products

This Section applies to EA Services for play on a Personal Computer ("EA PC Products"). To access and use EA Services associated with an EA PC Product, you may first need to register with the serial code enclosed with the EA PC Product.

A. Technical and Content Protection Measures

EA utilizes certain technical or content protection measures to prevent piracy and the unauthorized copying or use of an EA PC Product. EA PC Products use Origin Online Activation and also may use Sony DADC Austria AG's Denuvo content protection technology. To see which games use Denuvo, visit https://www.ea.com/legal. An EA Account, including the acceptance of this Agreement and EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com, installation of the Origin client application (https://www.origin.com/en-us/about), acceptance of the Origin EULA, and an Internet connection are required to authenticate the EA PC Product and verify your license upon the initial launch of the EA PC Products on any unique machine ("Authenticate" or "Authentication"). The serial code provided with this EA PC Products will be verified during Authentication. Authentication is limited to one EA Account per serial code, which means the EA PC Product is not transferable. EA may validate your license by subsequent online Authentication. There is no limit to the total number of machines on which the EA PC Products can be Authenticated, but you may launch and access the EA PC Product on no more than five unique machines in any rolling 24-hour period. <ter2>If you attempt to circumvent, disable or tamper with these technical protection measures, the EA PC Product may not function properly and this License shall terminate for your material breach.</ter2> Keep your serial code because you may need it to install the EA PC Service on other machines. This technology may interfere with certain applications, such as debuggers, that can be used to circumvent access-control technology.

B. Monitoring

EA utilizes certain technologies to detect and prevent cheating in connection with the use of EA PC Products. These are described below. You can visit https://www.ea.com/legal to know which technology is used with each EA PC Product.

Punkbuster. EA may use Punkbuster Anti-Cheat technology from Even Balance, Inc. You may opt to install Punkbuster during the installation of an EA PC Product. If it is installed, when you connect online to a game server using Punkbuster, Punkbuster will monitor your computer's random access memory (RAM) for Unauthorized Third Party Programs running concurrently with the EA PC Product and any modifications to the EA PC Product's files enabling or facilitating cheating. An Unauthorized Third Party Program is a third party program or file (such as a "addon", "mod", "hack", "trainer", or "cheat") that EA believes (i) enables or facilitates cheating of any type: (ii) allows users to modify or hack the game interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly authorized by EA: or (iii) Intercepts, "mines", or otherwise collects information from or through the game. If you uninstall the EA PC Product, Punkbuster will remain dormant on your computer. To uninstall Punkbuster, run the executable at https://www.evenbalance.com/downloads/pbsvc/pbsvc.exe.

EA Anti-Cheat Technologies. EA may use its own anti-cheat technologies. When you connect online to a game server, these technologies will activate and monitor your game play, the game files associated with the EA PC Product and your computer's RAM. These technologies detect cheating and Unauthorized Third Party Programs running concurrently with the EA PC Product and any modifications to the EA PC Product's files enabling or facilitating cheating.

If any of these anti-cheat technologies detects cheating, we may collect relevant information, including your account name, details about an Unauthorized Third Party Program and the EA PC Product files modification detected, and the time and date it was detected. <ter2>We also may terminate your License and your EA Account if we determine you have been cheating.</ter2>

When you disconnect from the game server, these anti-cheat technologies will be deactivated.

C. Uninstalling

You may uninstall EA PC Products at any time within your game settings in the Origin client. Certain locally saved files may remain on your computer after uninstallation. You may manually delete these files by searching for the game title in your My Documents folder on PC or via the file finder on a Mac.

8. Termination and Other Sanctions

<ter3>This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or EA.</ter3> <ter2>EA may terminate your access and use of any EA Services or your EA Account if EA determines that you have violated this Agreement or that there has been otherwise unlawful, improper or fraudulent use of EA Services associated with your EA Account.</ter2> When practical, EA will notify you of the termination. You may lose your user name and persona as a result of an EA Account termination. <ter2>If you have more than one EA Account, depending on the type of violation or misuse, EA may terminate all of your EA Accounts and all related Entitlements.</ter2> If your EA Account is terminated, you will not have access to your EA Account or Entitlements and may be barred from accessing or using any EA Service again. Upon termination, your license under this Agreement also shall terminate.

<cr2><ter2><ch2>Instead of termination and prior to any termination, EA may issue you a warning, suspend or alter your access to a particular EA Service or your EA Account, remove or revoke Entitlements at an EA Account or device level, remove or delete any content which is in violation with this Agreement, or ban your device or machine from accessing specific EA Services.</ch2></ter2></cr2> If EA takes any action described in this Section, you will not be entitled to a refund (subject to any statutory refund rights) and no Entitlements will be credited to you or converted to cash or other forms of reimbursement.

<ter3>EA may terminate any EA Service at any time by giving at least thirty days' notice either via email (if available), within the affected EA Service, or on the service updates page of EA's website (https://www.ea.com/service-updates).</ter3> After online service termination, no software updates will be applied to our games and we can't guarantee our mobile games will continue be available for download via iCloud (or other applicable cloud services).  Any games available via iCloud after online service termination may be removed from iCloud without further notice to you.

If you believe that any action has been taken against your Account or device in error, please contact Customer Support at help.ea.com.

Sections 5, 8-9, 11-15 of this Agreement survive termination of this Agreement.

9. Use of Data

When you use an EA Service, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device, including information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your EA Service usage, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware (for example, to protect your game stats, EA may place a randomly generated identification number in the keychain storage of your device. That identifier will be removed when you reset your device). If you play an EA Service offline, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet. EA uses this information to operate its business, improve its products and services, provide services to and communicate with you (including for marketing purposes), provide software updates, dynamically served content and software support, and trouble-shoot bugs or otherwise enhance your experience. If you participate in online services, EA also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and achievements), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.

Your data is collected, used, stored and transmitted by EA Inc. in the United States, in accordance with EA's Privacy and Cookie Policy at privacy.ea.com.

10. Other Software, Utilities and Tools

EA Services may require or allow you to download software, software updates or patches, or other utilities and tools from EA or its licensors onto your computer, entertainment system or device. These technologies may be different across platforms, and the performance of EA Services may vary depending on your computer and other equipment. You understand that certain updates to these technologies may be required in order to continue use of an EA Services. Some of these updates may contain locked features or content that require you to pay an additional fee to access them. You consent to EA automatically installing any available updates for EA Services. Failure to install available updates may render EA Services, including EA PC Products, unplayable.

11. Third-Parties

Some EA Services may give you the option of playing on servers not owned or controlled by EA. EA does not control those services and is not responsible for your use of the EA Service on or through them. These third party services may subject you to additional or different terms and restrictions.

EA Services may include hyperlinks to third party web sites. Those sites may collect data or solicit personal information from you. EA does not control those sites and is not responsible for their content or for their collection, use or disclosure of personal information.

This Section is an agreement between you and EA, and applies to our respective agents, employees, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, beneficiaries and assigns. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. This Section shall be interpreted broadly and shall survive termination of this Agreement.

A. Claims Covered by Arbitration

<a2>All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any EA Service and its marketing, or the relationship between you and EA ("Disputes") shall be determined exclusively by binding arbitration.</a2> This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. The only Disputes not covered by this Section are claims (i) regarding the infringement, protection or validity of your, EA's or EA's licensors' trade secrets or copyright, trademark or patent rights; (ii) if you reside in Australia, to enforce a statutory consumer right under Australia consumer law; and (iii) brought in small claims court.

B. Informal Negotiations

You and EA shall first attempt to resolve any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. The informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ("Notice of Dispute"). The Notice of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing or email address. You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.

C. Binding Arbitration

<a2>If you and EA cannot resolve a Dispute informally, you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.</a2> <a2>Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.</a2> The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, EA will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

D. Limitations

YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator shall not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

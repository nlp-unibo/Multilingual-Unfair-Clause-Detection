Please note, however, that any contracts that are constructed after the end of the sale of the Items will only be entered into between you and the Seller of the Product (and NOT Groupon International, unless Groupon International is the Seller).
The seller is responsible for selling and settling any claims or other problems related to the contract between you and the seller.
It should also be remembered that when you purchase a Voucher, in addition to the sales contract with the Voucher Seller, you also conclude an agreement with the entity that delivers the Products after you use the Voucher ("Contractor").
In the case of Vouchers, neither we nor the Seller are responsible (we) for any contracts relating to the implementation of the Voucher concluded between you and the Contractor.
Please also remember that we never act as the Seller's agent or the Contractor's agent.
